  EXAMPLE 3

    Variante of a complex calculator with two IDL files. This is another
    decomposition of IDL specification.

    Cplx.idl is the same, CalcCplx.idl contains :

        #include "Cplx.idl"
        module Cplx {
            interface CalcCplx {
                Complex Add(in Complex val1, in Complex val2);
                Complex Sub(in Complex val1, in Complex val2);
            };
        };

    The build process is the same.
